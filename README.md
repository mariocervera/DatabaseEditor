# Database Editor

This repository contains a set of Eclipse plug-ins that implement a graphical database editor. This
editor allows the user to define (as models) database schemas (i.e., the structure of databases in
terms of tables, views, columns, data types, primary keys, foreign keys, etc.) and also to automatically
generate (DDL) code for PostgreSQL. To develop this editor, I used Java and also model-driven Eclipse
technologies such as the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), the Eclipse Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF),
and two model transformation languages: Xpand and ATL.
