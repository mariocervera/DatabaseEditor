# Database Editor

This repository contains a set of Eclipse plug-ins that implement a graphical database editor. This
editor allows the user to define database schemas (i.e., the structure of the database in terms of
tables, views, columns, data types, primary keys, foreign keys, etc.) and also to automatically generate
(DDL) code for PostgreSQL.
